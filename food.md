## Food
The local food ‘lingo’:
New Mexico is home to one of the only places in the US where you
can readily find green chile as an optional add-on to your food
(even at large franchised/fast food chains!). We are only ~40 mi
south of Hatch, New Mexico where the Hatch chile is from, so this
is the place to try it! If you’re not a fan of spicy food, there
are mild green chile options that aren’t painfully hot, just ask
your servers about the level of spiciness.  Green vs Red: most
places will ask if you want green chile/salsa or red chile/salsa,
or ‘christmas’ which is a mix of both green and red! If you’re not
sure which you’ll like more, christmas is a great option to try
both out.

NOTE: Many restaurants close at 9:00pm!
