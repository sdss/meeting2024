The meeting will consist of plenary and parallel talks on June 3-5 in Domenici Hall on
the NMSU campus.  June 6-7 will feature breakout sessions by Mapper in the same building.
On Thursday afternoon (June 6), we will lead a visit to Apache Point Observatory; there is a limited capacity of 70 visitors on the APO trip, and registrants should indicate their interest in the trip at the time of registration.
