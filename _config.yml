  The fifth Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-V) is an all-sky, multi-epoch
  spectroscopic survey that will yield optical and infrared spectra
  of over 6 million objects during its five-year lifetime (2020–2025).
  Using SDSS’s existing and anticipated new facilities at Apache Point
  Observatory and Las Campanas Observatory, SDSS-V will survey the
  entire sky — mapping the Milky Way using rapid, repeated observations,
  mapping Local Volume galaxies using wide-angle integral field
  spectroscopy, and mapping black holes using time-domain spectroscopy
  of quasars and bright X-ray sources.

  For more information please visit the SDSS-V website.
  SDSS members can also visit the SDSS-V Wiki.
