## 2024 SDSS-V Collaboration Meeting

### June 3-7, 2024, New Mexico State University

[*Pay your registration fees here*](https://commerce.cashnet.com/nmsuSDSSpay)

The 2024 SDSS-V Collaboration Meeting will be held on the campus
of New Mexico State University in Las Cruces, NM.  Las Cruces is nestled 
in the morning shadow of the breathtaking Organ Mountains and is home to
a friendly culture infused with unique Borderland flavor.  

The SDSS-V project involves three
key projects — the Milky Way Mapper, the Local Volume Mapper, and
the Black Hole Mapper — that will together observe nearly 6 million
stars in the Milky Way and satellite galaxies, 400,000 black holes
and galaxy clusters, and 3000 square degrees of the ionized ISM from APO and
LCO! The first public data release was in January 2023 with internal
data products now being released to collaboration. With these
exciting milestones, the collaboration meeting this year will be
devoted to SDSS-V science talks, status updates, and tutorials,
with both plenary and splinter sessions, from June 3-7 2024.
June 3-5 will be collaboration meeting talks/discussions and 
June 6-7 will be breakout sessions and workshops for the
individual mappers. On June 6, we will facilitate a field trip to 
the Apache Point Observatory (limited capacity).

The fifth Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-V) is an all-sky, multi-epoch
spectroscopic survey that will yield optical and infrared spectra
of over 6 million objects during its five-year lifetime (2020–2025).
Using SDSS’s existing and anticipated new facilities at Apache Point
Observatory and Las Campanas Observatory, SDSS-V will survey the
entire sky — mapping the Milky Way using rapid, repeated observations,
mapping Local Volume galaxies using wide-angle integral field
spectroscopy, and mapping black holes using time-domain spectroscopy
of quasars and bright X-ray sources.
