## Air travel

[El Paso International](https://www.elpasointernationalairport.com/) is the nearest airport, about 1 hour drive from Las Cruces, and is recommended for getting to the area. 

## Getting to Las Cruces from ELP

We recommend the [Las Cruces Shuttle](https://www.lascrucesshuttle.com/) service for transportation from/to the airport.  Attendees should book their shuttle as soon as possible after booking flights.  The shuttle will run at least 9 trips on Sunday, June 2nd, but can possibly run a few more according to demand.

The El Paso airport contains a full suite of rental car options, and carpooling is strongly encouraged if attendees opt for this mode of transport.  

Rideshare services Lyft and Uber are usually available but can get pricey going to/from the airport depending on time of day, surge pricing, etc. 

Please use [the Rides and Roommates wiki page](https://wiki.sdss.org/display/SDSS/2024+SDSS-V+Collaboration+Meeting+Rides+and+Roommates) for coordinating rides to/from the airport.
