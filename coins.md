The Committee On INclusiveness in SDSS ([COINS](https://wiki.sdss.org/display/COINS/COINS)) was formed to address issues having to do with diversity, inclusion, and equality in the survey. Our broad goals are to assess the SDSS project and collaboration's climate and demographics, to recommend to the collaboration management new policies or practices with regard to increasing inclusiveness, and to assist in the implementation of these new activities where necessary. We publicize our findings to the collaboration and ensure that resources that promote inclusivity are widely accessible. We aim to provide the collaboration tools to improve the climate of equity and inclusion.

## COINS Recommendations for Meetings

We direct <b>Attendees and Presenters</b> to the relevant sections of [Meeting Accessibility](https://sdss.github.io/coins/documents/md/meeting_accessibility.html). Some suggestions for an accessible and inclusive meeting environment overlap with general guidelines for being respectful and courteous, while others are related to more specific issues. Please contribute to a positive and inclusive conference.

We also ask <b>Session Chairs</b> to adhere to the [Guildelines for chairing sessions at SDSS meetings](https://sdss.github.io/coins/documents/md/chairing_guidelines.html).

For other general COINS documents and related materials please see the [COINS repository](https://sdss.github.io/coins/documents/md/).
